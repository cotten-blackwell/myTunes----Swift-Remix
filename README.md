iPhone app for browsing music playlists (working prototype)

In one of my first learning projects, I built a fun playlist browser that demonstrates two crucial aspects of an iOS app - navigation and how to pass information around. It also showcases how to work with multiple view controllers and how to transition between them using segues and navigation controllers. Other key learning included in the app: data modeling, Auto Layout and the foundational Master-Detail concepts of iOS development.
